            <h2>Welcome to the CREATE Lab</h2>

            <p>The Community Robotics, Education and Technology Empowerment Lab (CREATE Lab) explores socially meaningful innovation and deployment of robotic technologies. We specifically aim to:</p>

            <p>
                <strong>Empower a technologically fluent generation through</strong> experiential learning opportunities in and outside of school. We define technology fluency as the confidence to author / creatively configure technology to pursue individual and collective goals.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Empower everyday citizens and scientists</strong> with affordable environmental sensing and documentation instruments, and powerful visualization platforms for sense-making and sharing of gathered scientific data - to promote evidence based decision making, public discourse and action.
