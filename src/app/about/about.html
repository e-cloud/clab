        <p>The JETS Lab is a collection of scholars committed to work that improves
            the environment and reduces environmental inequities. We tackle a set of problems that are
            particularly hard to solve from the grassroots level: disparities in access to meaningful
            information, cutting edge technology, and community-friendly scientific experts. We consider
            ourselves most successful when our academic research pays off for communities fighting for
            environmental justice.</p>

        <h3>JETS Lab Contributors</h3>
        <p>Gwen Ottinger received her Ph.D. from the <a href="#">Energy and Resources Group</a> at the University of
            California, Berkeley, where she first began working with environmental justice activists and refinery
            communities on issues of air toxics monitoring. As an Assistant Professor in Drexel University’s <a
                href="#" target="_blank">Department of Politics</a> and <a href="#" target="_blank">Center for Science, Technology, and Society
                (STS)</a>, she has amassed the <a
                href="http://drexel.edu/~/media/Files/histpol/cvs/Ottinger%20Web%20CV.ashx?la=en" target="_blank">usual list of
                publications and honors</a>. She is especially grateful for the reception that her book, <a href="#" target="_blank">Refining
                Expertise: How Responsible Engineers Subvert Environmental Justice Challenges</a>, has <a href="#" target="_blank">received
                from the STS community</a>; it is a reminder of what can come from pouring heart and soul into a
            project. After completing the book, Ottinger packed three of her dream projects--a history of the air
            monitoring “buckets,” a participatory design project to put real-time air data to better use, and a
            community-based ethics course for aspiring scientists and engineers--into one NSF proposal, which was
            ultimately funded. She is delighted and humbled by the chance to carry out these projects in collaboration
            with exceptional students and collaborators.</p>
